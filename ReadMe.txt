For both codes, including and not including adaptation, comment or uncomment corresponding lines in files "initialize" and "params". Files:
gamma_simulator: main file.rastergram3: makes the raster plots.initialize: contains initial conditions for the 4 networks (L3 to PMd, L5 to PMd, L3 to AMY, L5 to AMY).	No adaptation:	Comment/uncomment lines from: 4-6, 9-11, 14-16, 19-21, correspondingly for each network. 	Adaptation:	Comment/uncomment lines from: 4-7, 10-13, 16-19, 22-25, correspondingly for each network. params: contains the parameters of the system for the 4 networks.	No adaptation:	Comment/uncomment lines from: 22-25, 36-46, 74-88, correspondingly for each network.	Modify line 107 to change the deterministic drive.	Uncomment line 110 to have only a deterministic drive.	Comment line 110 and uncomment lines 111 or 112 to add a stochastic drive.	Adaptation:	Comment/uncomment lines from: 44-52, 63-73, 101-115, correspondingly for each network.	Modify line 134 to change the deterministic drive.	Uncomment line 139 to have only a deterministic drive.	Comment line 139 and uncomment lines 140 or 141 to add a stochastic drive.	Change the percentage in line 6 and g_sa in line 25 accordingly for each network.
